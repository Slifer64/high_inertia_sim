- With such slow movements, no significant perceptible inertial forces emerge...

- With "mo" very small, the noise from the sensors makes the system behave badly!
  This can be alleviated by increasing the total inertia, via "M"

- t_sim = 0.002 and t_ctrl = 0.008 ms produces no problems


So ultimately, we just want to make an admittance, where the noise from the F/T sensors is properly handled...
